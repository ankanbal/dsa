# Data Structure and Algorithms Practise and Questions
This is a list of Data Structure and Algorithms questions categorized into solving patterns. 
I try to solve DSA problems on a daily basis and push them here.

## Patterns of the questions
1. Sliding Window 
1. Two - Pointers and Fast-Slow Pointers 
1. Intervals
1. Dynamic Programming
1. Binary Trees
1. Array Misc
