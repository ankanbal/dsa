# Data Structure and Algorithms Practise and Questions
This is a list of Data Structure and Algorithms questions categorized into solving patterns. 
I try to solve DSA problems on a daily basis and push them here.

## Patterns of the questions
1. [Sliding Window](src/sliding_window) 
1. [Two - Pointers and Fast-Slow Pointers ](src/pointers)
1. [Intervals](src/merge_intervals)
1. [Dynamic Programming](src/dynamic_programming)
1. [Binary Trees](src/binary_tree)
1. [Array Misc](src/array_misc)
1. [Cyclic Sort](src/cyclic_sort)
1. [Linkedlist](src/linked_list)
1. [Heap](src/heap)
1. [Subset, Permutations and Combination](src/subset)
1. [Mathematical](src/mathematical)

Questions list present inside each pattern directory. 

The solutions here are written in Java.

But, Go deserves to be recognized for the go-to language for DSA as well. 

Find the same solutions in [Go here](https://github.com/kartavya-ramnani/datastructures-algorithms-go). 

Please feel free to raise issues if any solution is not optimal.
