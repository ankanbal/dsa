# Data Structure and Algorithms Practise and Questions
This is a list of Data Structure and Algorithms questions categorized into solving patterns. 
I try to solve DSA problems on a daily basis and push them here.

## Patterns of the questions
1. [Sliding Window](src/sliding_window) 
1. [Two - Pointers and Fast-Slow Pointers ](src/pointers)
1. [Intervals](src/merge_intervals)
1. [Dynamic Programming](src/dynamic_programming)
1. [Binary Trees](src/binary_tree)
1. [Array Misc](src/array_misc)
1. [Cyclic Sort](src/cyclic_sort)
1. [Linkedlist](src/linked_list)
1. [Heap](src/heap)
1. [Subset, Permutations and Combination](src/subset)

Questions list present inside each pattern directory. 

Currently, the solutions are written in Java. 
Future plan is providing the same solutions in Go. 

Please feel free to raise issues if any solution is not optimal.
