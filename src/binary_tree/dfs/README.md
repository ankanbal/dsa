## DFS in Binary Tree Questions

1. Given a binary tree and a number ‘S’, find if the tree has a path from root-to-leaf such that the sum of all the node values of that path equals ‘S’.

1. Given a binary tree and a number ‘S’, find all paths from root-to-leaf such that the sum of all the node values of each path equals ‘S’.

1. Given a binary tree where each node can only have a digit (0-9) value, each root-to-leaf path will represent a number. Find the total sum of all the numbers represented by all paths.

1. Given a binary tree and a number sequence, find if the sequence is present as a root-to-leaf path in the given tree.

1. Given a binary tree and a number ‘S’, find all paths in the tree such that the sum of all the node values of each path equals ‘S’. Please note that the paths can start or end at any node but all paths must follow direction from parent to child (top to bottom).

1. Given a binary tree, find the length of its diameter. The diameter of a tree is the number of nodes on the longest path between any two leaf nodes. The diameter of a tree may or may not pass through the root.

1. Find the path with the maximum sum in a given binary tree. Write a function that returns the maximum sum. A path can be defined as a sequence of nodes between any two nodes and doesn’t necessarily pass through the root.
