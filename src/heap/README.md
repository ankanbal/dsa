## Heap

1. Design a class to calculate the median of a number stream. The class should have the following two methods:

   insertNum(int num): stores the number in the class
   findMedian(): returns the median of all numbers inserted in the class.
   
   If the count of numbers inserted in the class is even, the median will be the average of the middle two numbers.

### Inside other patterns

1. Given a list of intervals representing the start and end time of ‘N’ meetings,
   Find the minimum number of rooms required to hold all the meetings.

1. We are given a list of Jobs. Each job has a Start time, an End time, and a CPU load when it is running.
   Our goal is to find the maximum CPU load at any time if all the jobs are running on the same machine.
